## Goal

To make a Bitcoin price reporter. Revisit how to use URLSession to make HTTP requests and JSONDecoder for JSON parsing.

## What I created

A Bitcoin price ticker. The app will give you the latest Bitcoin prices in all the popular, traded currencies, so you can track how well your Bitcoin investments are doing on the go.

## What I learned

* Learn to use URLSession to network and make HTTP requests.
* Parse JSON with the native Encodable and Decodable protocols.
